  <h1><strong>MathMakesArt Token (MATH)</strong></h1>
  <p>In October 2021 I deployed the <a href="https://mathmakes.art/MATH/"><strong>MATH token</strong></a>, my own custom <a href="https://tezos.com/learn/what-is-tezos/"><strong>Tezos</strong></a> token with FA2-compatibility.
  <br />A total of 8950 tokens were distributed between 1115 different wallet addresses, to each user who has collected at least one of my NFTs on <a href="https://www.hicetnunc.xyz"><strong>HicEtNunc</strong></a> in the 7 months between March and September 2021.</p>
  <p>Every user received a minimum of 1 token. The maximum number of tokens received by any user in this first distribution is 321 tokens, to Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/mathMakesArt/status/1443827161794818077"><strong>@Anarchytect2</strong></a>.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://tzkt.io/KT18hYjnko76SBVv6TaCT4kU6B32mJk6JWLZ/operations/"><strong>MATH contract</strong></a> itself is an instance of my <a href="https://github.com/mathMakesArt/ArtContracts"><strong>ArtContracts</strong></a> SmartPy contract, updated for Granada and modified to best facilitate the planned uses of MATH.</p>
  <br />
  <h2><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></h2>
  <h4><strong>This token is not intended as a monetary reward in any way, and has no associated value or exchange rate.</strong></h4>
  <p>I am offering zero promise of present or future performance with this MATH token airdrop.
  <br />MATH is only my own personal means of tracking supporters, and potentially offering further reward opportunities to the collectors who have supported me in the past.
  <br />While I can't prevent users from privately transacting or otherwise transferring their tokens, I would like to discourage participation by any users who are seeking the token as a financial opportunity.
  <br />The opportunity exists in the art itself, and in the community of my collectors who are now united under a single decentralized contract.</p>
  <br />
  <h2>More information coming soon!</h2>
  <h3><strong>Thank you for your patience.</strong></h3>

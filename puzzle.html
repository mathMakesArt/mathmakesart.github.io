  <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Could [the 96-character string] contain more than than the seed phrase and password?</p>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> There is no redundant information; Beyond the seed phrase and password, this string does not encode any other data.</p>
  <br />
  <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Are the words in the mnemonic phrase separated by spaces?</p>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> They are not necessarily separated, but the structure is designed in such a way that (if you've found the correct solution) you will know where each word starts and ends.</p>
  <br />
  <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Are the words in the mnemonic phrase [present] on the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt"><strong>BIP39 list</strong></a>?</p>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Yes, all 12 words from the seed phrase are present in the English <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt"><strong>BIP39 list</strong></a>.</p>
  <br />
  <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did you pick the 12 word seed phrase or was it chosen at random by the wallet software?</p>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> I picked the 12-word seed phrase myself. If you're familiar with seed phrase generation, you will know that the twelfth word is restricted to a smaller set that depends on the other eleven words. But the first 11 words were chosen directly by me, with a direct purpose in the puzzle's solution.</p>
